Potential rev.4 turing machine boards

Changelog  
- Two boards, includes Backpack  
- Pulse out = like step one of the pulses expander 
- Rotary length switch 
- Improved clock input 
- Noise level trimmer & reduced voltage in noise circuit to make circuit more robust with different noise transistors 
- Larger board (in same HP) = easier layout 
- 2 x transistors & resistors removed, replaced by spare 4016 gates used as inverters 
- Compatible with old expanders
